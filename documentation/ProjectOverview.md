# Project Overview | Warframe Companion App

This file serces as a detailed document diving deeper into the project's background, objectives, and structire.

## Description

The Warframe Companion is a web-based tool designed to help players manage and track their Warframes, weapons, and other in-game items. The app allows users to easly search for and filter items, view detailed information, and keep track of their in-game progress.

## Project Background

This project came about while I am trying to complete my Codex. The "Codex" in warframe is essentially a checklist of items you need to collect and master to rank up your Mastery in the game. I find the completion of the Codex to be the most fun part about the game.

The problem comes with keeping track of what I need. There's a game mode called Void Fissures. This is where you "crack relics" to obtain pieces to the "Prime" versions of weapons and warframes. You have 15 seconds upon completing a Void Fissure to select the item you want. The UI in the game does not easily let you know what you do and don't need. If you have the blueprint (unbuilt), you will see a checkmark (and a number if you have more than one). However, if you build it, you will no longer see that you have the item. I often end up taking an item I no longer need. Another thing these item selection screens on the Void Fissure missions doesn't tell you is if you already mastered the weapon.

## Objectives and Goals

- Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for searching and filtering Warframe items.
- Implement a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Develop the app as a portfolio project, showcasing React, JSON data handling, and front-end design, while simultaniously providing myself with a tool to enhance my experience playing Warframe.

## Target Audience

The primary audience for this companion app is the WArframe players who want to better manage and track thier in-game items. This app is suitable for both new players looking to organize thier inventory, and long-time players seeking a comprehensive tool to be able to fill out their codex for mastery rank.

## Timeline

While I do not have a set date this needs to be completed by, I have created a roadmap of when I would like to work on the various pieces of this project. Please note, designs are part of this project, however, the focus of this project is functionality. UI/UX research will not be conducted to begin with. My first priority is getting a working app, and will be improving on it as I go.

- Week 1-2:
  - Planning and Initial Setup
  - Wireframes & Initial Designs
- Week 3-4:
  - Create JSON file with **Prime Warframes** and **Prime Weapons**.
  - Connect the JSON to the project.
  - Have the functionality of the Cards working.
  - Search is implemented.
- Week 5+:
  - Design Refinement
  - Additional JSON items created.
  - Saving to Local Host
